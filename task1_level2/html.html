        <h2>Biographical Information</h2>
        <h3>Early Life and Education:</h3>
        <p>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in the village of Mvezo in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. He was a member of the Thembu royal family. His father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa, was a local chief, and Mandela was given the name "Rolihlahla," which means "pulling the branch of a tree" or metaphorically, "troublemaker."

            Mandela's early education began at a local missionary school, where he received the name "Nelson" from a teacher, as was the custom to give African students English names. He later attended the Clarkebury Boarding Institute and Healdtown, a Methodist secondary school, where he excelled in academics and sports.</p>
        <h3>Lawyer and Activist:</h3>
        <p>In 1939, Mandela enrolled at the University of Fort Hare, the only residential higher education institution for black South Africans at the time. However, he was expelled for participating in a student protest. He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree through correspondence courses and then moved to Johannesburg to study law at the University of Witwatersrand.

            In Johannesburg, Mandela became involved in the African National Congress (ANC), a political organization fighting against racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the apartheid government. He became increasingly active in advocating for the rights of black South Africans.</p>
        <h3>The Struggle Against Apartheid:</h3>
        <p>As apartheid laws tightened, Mandela's activism escalated. In 1952, he and Oliver Tambo established the first black law firm in South Africa, providing legal aid to those affected by apartheid policies. Mandela's involvement in protests and activism led to his arrest multiple times.

            In 1962, Mandela was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment for his involvement in anti-apartheid activities, including the founding of the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe ("Spear of the Nation"). He spent 27 years in prison, primarily on Robben Island, becoming a symbol of resistance and international pressure against apartheid.</p>

        <h3>Release and Presidency:</h3>
        <p>In 1990, due to mounting international pressure and shifting political dynamics in South Africa, Mandela was released from prison. The apartheid regime began to dismantle, and negotiations for a peaceful transition of power began. In 1993, Mandela was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize along with former South African President F.W. de Klerk for their efforts in ending apartheid.

            In 1994, South Africa held its first multiracial democratic elections, and Nelson Mandela became the country's first black president. He worked to reconcile the deeply divided nation and implement policies to address social and economic inequalities.</p>
        <h3>Legacy:</h3>
        <p>Nelson Mandela's presidency marked a significant turning point in South Africa's history. His commitment to reconciliation and forgiveness helped prevent widespread violence during the transition. He served as president until 1999, after which he focused on global peace efforts, humanitarian work, and raising awareness about issues such as HIV/AIDS.

            Nelson Mandela passed away on December 5, 2013, at the age of 95. He left behind a legacy of courage, resilience, and a commitment to justice that continues to inspire people worldwide in the ongoing fight for equality and human rights.</p>
